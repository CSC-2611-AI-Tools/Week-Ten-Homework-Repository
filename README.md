## Assignment 13
Upload an HTML of the completed notebook for credit.

Follow through the attached notebook to run and complete all cells.  Make sure you read the instructions to learn the steps (the goal isn't 
to complete it quickly but to learn the steps).  

In addition, please write your own cosine distance function within this file.

**Note:** We have not covered the concepts of PCA and SVD. If time permits, I will cover this content later in this semester. Otherwise, you will learn these concepts in the Data Science course.
